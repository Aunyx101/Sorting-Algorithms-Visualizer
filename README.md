Project: [Sorting Algorithms Visualized]

Introduction: 
In order for better understanding of a particular sorting algorithm, we implemented this web-based 
application where such sorting algorithms are visualized. It showcases the inner workings 
of sorting algorithms. Implemented algorithms are: 

1) Bubble sort 
2) Insertion sort 
3) Merge sort 
4) Bucket Sort
5) Count Sort
6) Radix Sort 
7) Heap sort
8) Quick sort
   
Abstract: 
The Web application will display colored representation of steps that are being executed e.g., light-blue 
representing sorted array, light-red representing unsorted array, dark-red representing comparisons and pivot 
and finally lime-green representing iterative head/point. The application can also alter the speed of execution as 
well as determine the total time taken in order to sort an array (that is read from a .txt file). [Note: ‘Speed Of
Sort’ will affect the total time taken in sorting via a chosen algorithm.]

Programming Design:
The technologies we used 
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap.
  
Experimental Setup: 
We used ‘codepen.io’ for our experimental setup with basic HTML, CSS and JS implementation for Bubble 
Sort. 

Conclusion: 
Our Web Application is accurate and efficient. It gives the required output via the required manner
that is visualization of sorting algorithms.
